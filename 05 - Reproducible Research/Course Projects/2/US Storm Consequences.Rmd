##Synopsis

This analysis attempts to use the National Weather Service's Storm Data Documentation to answer two questions about US storms.

Which storm types are the most harmful with respect to population health?

Which storm types have the greatest economic consequences?

//Results synopsis here


##Data Processing

In this section we will take our raw data and transform in into something we can work with easily to answer our questions.

First, we will download and store the data.

```{r download and store, cache=TRUE}
download.file("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2", destfile="StormData.csv")

stormdata <- read.csv("StormData.csv")
```

So, what variables do we have to work with?

```{r storm variables}
colnames(stormdata)
```
